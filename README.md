Date Format Helper
======================

The Date Format Helper adds a list of the PHP date format options on the
"Add date format" page.  It eliminates the need to open a second browser window
to remember if 'm' is a textual or numeric repesentation of the current month,
or was 'm' minutes?  Maybe that was 'M'?  I can never remember.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- Add a new date format under Administration > Configuration > Regional and
  language > Date and time formats > Add date format.

- Enjoy the on-page docs and never look up a date formatting option again.
